				The term dinosaur comes from the fact that every animal inside that category, share some biological traits. Due to the enormous 
				number of dinosaurs, some might wonder what keeps some dinosaurs similar, and what keep some dinosaurs from being the same species. 
				To get a better grasp of how dinosaurs are categorized, we need to start with the two largest categories.
			</p>
			<h2>Ornithischians and Saurischians:</h2>
			<img alt="Dinosaur Classification Tree" src="Bilder/DinoTree.jpg">
			<p>
				Right after the category "Dinosauria" that includes every dinosaur, comes the categories "Ornithischia" and "Saurischia". The qualifications
				for each category has to do with the shape of the dinosaurs hip bones. For some dinosaurs, two of the bones in the hip, known as the pubis and 
				the ischium, are really close together. These dinosaurs are called bird-hipped dinosaurs(Ornithischians) because their hips resemble those of modern 
				day birds.
			</p>
			<p>
				The other dinosaurs have hips where the pubis and the ischium are far apart from eachother. These are called lizard-hipped dinosaurs
				(Saurischians) because their hips resemble those of lizards. All of the modern day birds are in this category, but have ironically further evolved 
				to have hips like the Ornithischians.
			</p>
			<h2>Theropods and Sauropodomorphs:</h2>

			<p>
				Saurischians are then further classified into two smaller groups, Theropods and Sauropodomorphs. Theropods are one of the most well known 
				groups of dinosaurs and they share traits such as hollow bones, carnivorous diet and three-toed feet with sharp claws. The other group, 
				called sauropodomorphs are mostly known for their large size and long necks. However, This wasn't the case for the early sauropodomorphs. 
				Many of them were smaller and able to stand on they're hind legs. Due to evolution, these sauropodomorphs grew larger and larger until they 
				became permanent quadrupeds and turned into the classic sauropods we all know and love.
			</p>
			<h2>Thyreophora and Ornithopods:</h2>
			<p>
				Ornithischians are furthur classified into Thyreophora and Ornithopods. Inside the group Thyreophora are the dinosaurs that have some sort of 
				armour or bony buildups protruding and covering the skin. These bony build ups could have been used for multible different purposes depending 
				on which dinosaur we're talking about. The ankylosaurus used it for defense, and dinosaurs like the Stegosaurus probably used it for thermoregulation 
				or sexual display. The other group, known as Ornithopods are a bit more diverse. The name Ornithopods stands for "Bird-Feet" and is due to the fact that 
				they had three toes. It's good to know that the modern day birds aren't decendants of this group and only come from the theropod group. The Ornithopods 
				are also known for being able to chew tough plants like modern day cows and horses.
