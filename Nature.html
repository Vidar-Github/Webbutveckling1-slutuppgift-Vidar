			<h2>Climate</h2>
			<p>
				The climate during the Mesozoic Era was generally warm, and there was less difference in temprature at equatorial and polar latitudes.
				The Mesozoic Era was a time of geologic and biological change. During this era, the supercontinent Pangea split into the configuration 
				of continents we have today. A distinct modernization of life-forms occurd, partly due to the three mass extinctions that occurd during 
				this time, and the demise of many earlier types of organisms.

			<h2>Geology</h2>

			<p>
				During the start of the Mesozoic Era, the continents were joined together into the supercontinent known as Pangea. The fragmentation of 
				Pangea started during the late Triassic were it split into two smaller continents known as Laurasia and Gondwana. These continents 
				went through furthur fragmentation and by the mid Jurassic, the supercontinent was divided into Gondwana, Eurasia and what we today know as 
				North America. By the late Jurassic, Gondwana had started to split into South America and Africa, and Austrailia and Antartica had 
				seperated from Eurasia. These changes went on to become the continents we have today.

			<p>
				The temperature of the three periods of the Mesozoic era were generally warmer than the temprature today, and there was a smaller 
				difference between the temperature of the north and south poles, and the equator. The difference between summer abd winter temperatures 
				were also less significant. To the left you can see the average temperatures of each indiviuall period.
